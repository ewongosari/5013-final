# **Design Documentation**

Our project, **Ed+Tech** (pronounced as **“edplustech”**), is an interactive website providing 21st-century educators with technology-based resources they need to support their pedagogy in their student-centered classrooms. It serves as a platform for educators with an interest or need in educational technology to find, learn, share and discuss all kinds of edtech topics. It can be accessed at this [Github Page](https://ewongosari.github.io/5013-final/) or at this [Firebase Page](https://final-a47af.firebaseapp.com/). We have utilized Jesse Garrett's *Model of 5 Elements of User Experience* in our design thinking process, and they are outlined in the following sections:

## Topic
Our project is related to the subject of educational technology integration. Noticing the time-consuming research and comparison processes involved in looking for appropriate educational technology resources, this website combines resources finding and forum participation to build an edtech virtual learning community that can learn together and help each other out. Our website is a small part of the bigger domain of teacher professional development and it can be used in adjunction with other websites, programs, or networks specializing on teaching and training teachers in the realms of edtech.

## Problem
These are the main problems educators face in educational technology integration which can influence the effectiveness of their pedagogy:
1. Educators interested in educational technology want to apply technology in their classrooms but do not know what tools are available, which one fits their class the most, or how to use them appropriately in terms of efficiency and pedagogy.

2. Educators interested in educational technology encounter difficulties in searching for professional development events that are focused on educational technology topics.

3. Educators interested in educational technology feel difficult in finding a community where those with similar interests can share ideas, ask questions, and look for help.

## Solution and Rationale
We determined a central portal of resource information is necessary to reduce **cognitive overload** and time-wasting because most edtech resource websites only have a single purpose and they are scattered all over the Web. We utilized the learning theories of **community of practice** and **connectivism** in the edtech virtual community. Our website is a safe digital space where educators in the same network can learn from each other’s ideas and experiences to enrich their own knowledge and skills. Having interactions with other people means that educators can be motivated to use our site more frequently and this is based on the **social learning** theory.

## Target Audience
Our target audience are K-12 teachers who want to learn and apply technology integration in their own classrooms but are still novice or intermediate practitioners. They can be interested in the topic because they are new teachers working in schools with strong technology initiatives, or they are teachers who already have many years of teaching experience but want to transform their lessons in order to adapt to their 21st-century students. We have described some user stories to put these types of users in more context:

### User Stories

**User Story 1:**

<img src="visual/user-paula.jpg" alt="Paula" width=400>

This is Paula and she is a 22-year old who has just graduated college with an elementary education degree. She works as a first-year teacher at a charter school in New York City that is starting a one-to-one iPad initiative in the new academic year. Paula is very excited because her classroom is selected to be a part of the pilot project but at the same time, she is terrified because her iPad skills are limited to productivity apps, games and Web browsing. She feels that she knows next to nothing about educational iPad apps. Fortunately, the school has set up a mentoring system where teachers who are more technology-savvy guide those who are not. She discusses her struggles with her mentor teacher who points out our website as an easy-to-use resource. Paula likes that the app filtering system has many different options so she can narrow down the filter results to those apps that are the most suitable. While browsing the site, she also enjoys the forum where she is able to communicate with other educators who are using the same apps as her and learn from their valuable tips and tricks. Paula then bookmarks the site as one of her top ten edtech resources.

**User Story 2:**

<img src="visual/user-henry.jpg" alt="Henry" width=400>

This is Henry and he is a 46-year old public school teacher who has been teaching for more than 20 years. His domain of expertise is in high school mathematics and he feels very good at this point in his teaching journey. However, he noticed with each incoming batch of students that they are increasingly digital-savvy and consume a lot of their free time online. Some of his students struggle with understanding the more abstract concepts of statistics and calculus. Henry then decides to leverage the power and functionalities of technology to flip his classroom, a technique he had read in one of the educational blogs he follows but does not have the chance to implement yet. As he researches deeper, he comes across our website and checks it out to find some apps he can use. Unexpectedly, Henry finds the forum to be very useful because flipped learning is one of the hottest topic of discussion and he can find other educators who have successfully used the technique in their classrooms. He engages in long conversations with them and asks feedback for his unit plans. In addition, he discovers relevant webinars about blended learning strategies through the PD Finder. The site quickly becomes one of Henry’s favorites and he actively shares it to his colleagues.

## Strategy

### Site Objective
Educators who have beginner or intermediate level in educational technology integration can use our website as a guide to edtech resources in order to reduce time and effort used in searching so they can focus more on lesson planning and implementation.

### Site Goals
1. Educators can browse and find edtech apps that suit their needs.

2. Educators can browse and find edtech professional development events that suit their needs and interests.

3. Educators can participate in a community of practice that discuss and share ideas and additional resources on educational technology integration.

### Success Metrics
For now, we can analyze user satisfaction from the Website feedback form they fill in after they have explored our website. But ideally, we want to be able to monitor site traffic, user clicks, bookmarked apps and events, user ratings and reviews of apps and PD events, and forum discussion content. Then we can analyze the collected data to figure out how to improve specific site navigation and user interaction as well as address any concerns or struggles our users have with the site's functionalities.

## User Tests
We did three user testings in the middle of building this final prototype. We focused on the layout, function, and overall user flow of the whole website. According to users' feedback, we conclude that: 1) For the landing page, all three users said the overall layout is simple and clear, easy to navigate through the menu (also in other pages) and the subpage column. The color palette is also much improved from our midterm version. 2) For the App Finder and PD Finder pages, all three users said they found it a great help in looking for EdTech apps and professional development events, and the design and logic behind it is really simple and obvious. They also liked that there are tutorials and reviews on each App Detailed page so they can see what they can do with the app and what other users think of it. and 3)For the Community page, they enjoyed reading through discussions about EdTech topics and wanted us to continue building the forum functionalities so they can actually write new messages on their own once they are logged in. Overall, the feedbacks are generally positive and we think our design is so far addressing the right problem and heading to the right direction with some needed modifications from the feedback.
