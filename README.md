## Project Description
Our project, **Ed+Tech** (pronounced as **“edplustech”**), is an interactive website providing 21st-century educators with technology-based resources they need to support their pedagogy in their student-centered classrooms. It serves as a platform for educators with an interest or need in educational technology to find, learn, share and discuss all kinds of edtech topics. There are 3 sub-pages: an App Finder page where educators can search for specific apps based on given filters, a PD Finder page where they can search for specific professional development events based on given filters, and a Community forum where they can discuss educational technology topics.
